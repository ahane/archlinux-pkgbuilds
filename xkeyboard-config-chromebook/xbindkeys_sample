# xbindkeys configuration file
# needs xvkbd installed
# inspired by the xbindkeys examples on the ArchWiki Chromebook page

# Ctrl+Arrows act the same as Alt+Arrows in ChromeOS, i.e. sending PageUp, PageDown, Home, End.
# Ctrl+Backspace as Delete.
# Example how to set F3 as Ctrl+R for reloading the page in Firefox (it's commented out), see README.md for details.

# Chromebook's Overview button (F5)
#     (shows all windows, see https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1047364?hl )
#     * KDE: map to Alt+t (i.e. "\A\t"), switch to next focused window, see also http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/47
#     * Gnome: map to to Alt+F1 or Super_L (i.e. "\A\[F1]", "\[Super_L]"), toggle Activites overview 
#            (doesn't really work in Gnome, disabling Print in Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Screenshots won't help).
#     There's another example (commented out) for same mapping if the patch that set F5 as PrintScr is commented out in the PKGBUILD

#Overview/Switch Window
#"xvkbd -text "\[Super_L]""  # Gnome
"xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\A\t""    # KDE
    m:0x0 + c:71
    Print 

#Overview/Switch Window if the patch setting F5 as PrintScr is commented out in the PKGBUILD
#"xvkbd -text "\[Super_L]""  # Gnome
#"xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\A\t""    # KDE
#    m:0x0 + c:71
#    F5


#Delete
"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\[Delete]'"
    m:0x4 + c:22
    Control + BackSpace

#End
"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\[End]'"
    m:0x4 + c:114
    Control + Right

#Home
"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\[Home]'"
    m:0x4 + c:113
    Control + Left

#Page Down
"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\[Page_Down]'"
    m:0x4 + c:116
    Control + Down

#Page Up
"xvkbd -xsendevent -text '\[Page_Up]'"
    m:0x4 + c:111
    Control + Up

#Reload in Firefox
#"xvkbd -xsendevent -text "\Cr""
#    m:0x0 + c:69
#    F3


# End of xbindkeys configuration
